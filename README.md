# COnvolutional-Neural-Network-witFunctional-API
I used Brain Tumor Dataset where I downloaded from Kaggle. There were two different folder one of them tumor positive images and other one is tumor negative images. All dataset had 278 images half of them is true and others negative. I built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Functional API. The model had 1 input 10 hidden 1 output layers. To prevent the overfitting 3 times was used drop. In the hidden layer Relu activation function was used, and softmax used in the output layer. When compiling model, Categorical Cross Entropy used as a loss function, Adamax used as an optimizer, and accuracy used as a metric. I apply 40 epochs and 128 batch size in this model. As a result, model training dataset accurcy is 1 and test dataset accuracy is .71.
